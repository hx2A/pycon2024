# PyCon 2024 Presentation Materials

This repo contains the presentation materials for the PyCon 2024 talk "Creative Coding with py5, the Python version of Processing."

You'll need to install py5 to run the example code.

Your best bet is to follow the [Install py5](https://py5coding.org/content/install.html) documentation on the [py5coding.org](https://py5coding.org) website, as that documentation provides the most complete setup instructions.

Several of the notebooks use the py5 or py5bot Jupyter Notebook kernels. The [Install py5](https://py5coding.org/content/install.html) documentation will tell you how to install that. One of the notebooks uses opencv, which you can install with `pip install opencv-python`.
